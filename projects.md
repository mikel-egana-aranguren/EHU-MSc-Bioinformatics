About
=====

The project is carried out from May to September. Two types of projects are available:

* Research project: it focuses on answering a scientific question and the candidate will exploit bioinformatics as a means to obtain such answer. The project will be assesed in terms of how different technologies were combined and the merit of the scientific answer. The dissertation will be produced as a scientific paper.

* Development project: it focuses on the the technical aspect of bioinformatics, and the candidate will develop a program or system to achieve an specific aim. The project will be assesed technically, thus the performance, overall design, implementation skills, etc. will be taken into account, rather than the scientific result. The dissertation will be produced as a technical report.

Each student should choose one of projects described bellow and contact the tutor. It is recommended that the project is chosen after the tutor has done her/his teaching (most probably in the second semester), since the teaching will be used to explain the project. The projects should be chosen by May and the tutors contacted by the students: the projects will be assigned in a first come first served basis, in the unlikely case of project overbooking.
