About
=====

The project is carried out from May to September. Two types of projects are available:

* Research project: it focuses on answering a scientific question and the candidate will exploit bioinformatics as a means to obtain such answer. The project will be assesed in terms of how different technologies were combined and the merit of the scientific answer. The dissertation will be produced as a scientific paper.

* Development project: it focuses on the the technical aspect of bioinformatics, and the candidate will develop a program or system to achieve an specific aim. The project will be assesed technically, thus the performance, overall design, implementation skills, etc. will be taken into account, rather than the scientific result. The dissertation will be produced as a technical report.

Each student should choose one of projects described bellow and contact the tutor. It is recommended that the project is chosen after the tutor has done her/his teaching (most probably in the second semester), since the teaching will be used to explain the project. The projects should be chosen by May and the tutors contacted by the students: the projects will be assigned in a first come first served basis, in the unlikely case of project overbooking.


Available projects
==================

Linked Data crawler for Metagenomics data (Development)
-------------------------------------------------------

* **Project description:** Linked Data (http://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/data) is widely used to publish Data on the Web in a machine friendly manner, resulting in the Linked Open Data (LOD) cloud (http://lod-cloud.net/). Life Sciences data comprisses a considerable part of the LOD cloud, including (possibly) Metagenomics data. The aim of this project is to develop Web crawler that automatically browses Linked Data datasets of the LOD and retrieves Metagenomics related data. The crawler should be configurable and Metagenomics should be the test case: the crawler will be the outcome of the project, regardless of the Metagenomics data retrieved (it is acceptable for the crawler to retrieve non-significant data, quality or quantity wise, if it is demonstrated that it is not a fault of the crawling process).
