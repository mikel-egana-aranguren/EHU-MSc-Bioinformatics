#### Methylation data analysis application (Development)

R is one of the most widel used computational environments used to analyze biological data. In the particular case of methylation data, there are several packages that provide a wide variety of tools to preprocess, visualize and analyze different types of data. Although the number of biologists that are able to use R is increasing, a simple, visual interface for these packages can be of great help. In that regard, it is worth of noting the shiny package that, with very few programing can be used to create nice looking web applications that run R code. The goal of this project is developing, using shiny, a web application that can be used to preprocess, visualize and analyze methylation data.
