<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>
Bioinformatics is the area that provides informatics tools to analyse the “Big Data” generated by advanced molecular biology technologies. A competent bioinformatician has to trully understand the biological nature of the problems derived from the current “Data tsunami” and has to master the technical skills to develop practical solutions (software, infrastructures, etc.) for the analysis. This University Specialist degree will provide students with both types of skills, biological knowledge and informatics expertise, and hence will make them able to develop bioinformatics-based technical solutions in academia or companies. Also, the degree will promote the interaction between the students of the different backgrounds.
<p>

<p>The degree will be taught 2015-2016, and it is under evaluation for the (very likely) UPV/EHU release. It is a EHU own "University Specialist" degree.

Entry requirements</h1>

<p>

Students of scientific and technical backgrounds are encouraged to apply, including professionals. The first half of the programme is divided to provide the appropriate tuition to each student, according to their background: students with a technical background (Computer science, engineering, physics, ...) should choose the Life Sciences path, whereas students with a biomedical background (Biologists, Medical Doctors, biochemists, environmentalists, ... ) should choose the Computer Science path. See programme for details. 

Students should be fluent in english (the tuition will be provided exclusively in english) and will be selected according to their CVs.
