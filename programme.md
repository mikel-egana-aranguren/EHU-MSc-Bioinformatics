In order for a student to be awarded the degree, 30 ECTS credits must be completed: 22 taught ECTS and a 8 ECTS research/development project including a dissertation. 1 ECTS is equivalent to a student working 30 hours: 10 tuition hours (Theory and/or lab practical work) and 20 homework hours.

In the first semester, a path must be chosen: (A) Life Sciences (for computer scientists) and (B) Computer Science (for life scientists). In the second semester, one of the three optional modules must be chosen: an optional module represents a concrete application of Bioinformatics.

1st semester (October â€“ February)
=================================

#### 1A.- Introduction to genetics (Compulsory for the life sciences path, 3 ECTS). 
* The Cell.
* DNA structure and Function.
* Mendelian and Quantitative Genetics.
* Linking genotype and phenotype.
* Genetics of bacteria and viruses.
* Population genetics.
* Genetics and evolution.

#### 1B.- Programming and Data Bases (Compulsory for the computer science path, 3 ECTS).
* Bioinformatics programming in Perl: regular expressions and file parsing, Perl libraries for bioinformatics.
* Introduction to computational complexity and R language.
* Object Oriented Programming with Python.
* Databases: managing and using relational databases, introduction to NoSQL databases.

#### 2.- Advanced computing (Compulsory, both paths, 6 ECTS).
* Introduction to Data mining and Heuristic Optimization: principal techniques and bioinformatics applications.
* UNIX: basic system administration (users, processes, file system), shell and shell scripting, implementation of UNIX pipelines and scheduled tasks.
* High Performance Computing: Infrastructures, Algorithms.
* Web technologies: Web servers, Web APIs and mash-ups, Web services. Life Sciences Semantic Web.

2nd Semester (February -  May)
==============================

#### 3.- Applied bioinformatics I, Variation Analysis (Compulsory, both paths, 5 ECTS). 

TBA.

#### 4.- Applied bioinformatics II, Expression analysis (Compulsory, both paths, 5 ECTS).

#### 5.- Bioinformatics applied to biomedicine (Optional for both paths, 3 ECTS).

TBA.

#### 6.- Bioinformatics applied to the environment, populations, and non-model organisms (Optional for both paths, 3 ECTS). 
* Metagenomics.
* Metabarcoding.
* Population genomics in non-model organisms (SNPs, ...). 
* Comparative genomics.
* Ecological informatics.
