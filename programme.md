In order for a student to be awarded the degree, 30 ECTS credits must be completed: 22 taught ECTS and a 8 ECTS research/development project including a dissertation. 1 ECTS is equivalent to a student working 30 hours: 10 tuition hours (Theory and/or lab practical work) and 20 homework hours.

In the first semester, a path must be chosen: (A) Life Sciences (for computer scientists) and (B) Computer Science (for life scientists). In the second semester, one of the three optional modules must be chosen: an optional module represents a concrete application of Bioinformatics.
